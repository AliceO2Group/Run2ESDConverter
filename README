# Run2 ESD to AOD converter

This is an helper executable to read Run2 ESD data and pump it to stdout
as a set of Arrow `BatchRecord`s. This is to be coupled with some yet to happen
development in DPL to chunk the stream into messages.

The `scripts/pythonReader.py` python script on the other hand is an initial 
attempt to demonstrate how this can also be processed using python + pandas.
